// "this" is the global object in non-strict mode, and undefined in strict mode
// As a side note, variables declared with let or const at the global level are not 
// stored in the global object, but instead in an inaccessible declarative environment 
// record, so our following example will give us a different result when using 
// let name = "Pinger" instead of var name = "Pinger"


// try replacing following var name = "Pinger" with let name = "Pinger" for differnt result
// make sure you close your browser window after changing var with let
// because when at first you declared "var name" it went to global window object
// and when you changed it to "let name", the "var name" in global window object is already
// present. so same value will produced even after changing var to let.
// So close to browser tab and open a new window for fresh global window object


var name = "Pinger"

let abc = {
    name: "Aamir",

    welcomeMsg: function () {
        return "Welcome " + this.name
    },
    welcomeMsgArrow: () => {
        return "Welcome " + this.name
    }
}
let msg = abc.welcomeMsg()
console.log(msg)

msg = abc.welcomeMsgArrow()
console.log(msg)
