// Practice exercise 3.1
// 1. Create an array to use as your shopping list with 3 items: "Milk,"
// "Bread," and "Apples."
// 2. Check your list length in the console.
// 3. Update "Bread" to "Bananas."
// 4. Output your entire list to the console.

// Practice exercise 3.2
// 1. Create an empty array to use as a shopping list.
// 2. Add Milk , Bread , and Apples to your list.
// 3. Update " Bread " with Bananas and Eggs .
// 4. Remove the last item from the array and output it into the console.
// 5. Sort the list alphabetically.
// 6. Find and output the index value of Milk .
// 7. After Bananas , add Carrots and Lettuce .
// 8. Create a new list containing Juice and Pop .
// 9. Combine both lists, adding the new list twice to the end of the first list.
// 10. Get the last index value of Pop and output it to the console.
// 11. Your final list should look like this:
// ["Bananas", "Carrots", "Lettuce", "Eggs", "Milk", "Juice",

// Practice exercise 3.3
// 1. Create an array containing three values: 1, 2, and 3.
// 2. Nest the original array into a new array three times.
// 3. Output the value 2 from one of the arrays into the console.

// Practice exercise 3.4
// 1. Create a new myCar object for a car. Add some properties, including,
// but not limited to, make and model , and values for a typical car or
// your car. Feel free to use booleans, strings, or numbers.
// 2. Create a variable that can hold the string value color . This variable
// containing a string value color can now be used to reference the
// property name within myCar . Then, use the variable within the square
// bracket notation to assign a new value to the color property in myCar .
// 3. Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it,
// such as forSale . Use the bracket notation once again to assign a new
// value to the forSale property to indicate whether the car is available
// for purchase.
// 4. Output make and model into the console.
// 5. Output the value of forSale into the console.

// Practice exercise 3.5
// 1. Create an object named people that contains an empty array that is
// called friends .
// 2. Create three variables, each containing an object, that contain one of
// your friend's first names, last names, and an ID value.
// 3. Add the three friends to the friend array.
// 4. Output it to the console

// Self-check quiz
// 1. Can you use const and update values within an array?
// 2. Which property in an array gives the number of items contained in the
// array?
// 3. What is the output in the console?
// const myArr1 = [1,3,5,6,8,9,15];
// console.log(myArr1.indexOf(0));
// console.log(myArr1.indexOf(3));
// 4. How do you replace the second element in an array myArr =
// [1,3,5,6,8,9,15] with the value 4?
// 5. What is the output in the console?
// const myArr2 = [];
// myArr2[10] = 'test'
// console.log(myArr2);
// console.log(myArr2[2]);
// 6. What is the output in the console?
// const myArr3 = [3,6,8,9,3,55,553,434];
// myArr3.sort();
// myArr3.length = 0;
// console.log(myArr3[0]);

// Summary
// So, in this chapter, we have seen arrays and objects. Arrays are a list of
// values. These could be values of the same type, but also values of different
// types. Every element of the array gets an index. The index of the first
// element is 0. We can access the elements of the array using this index. We
// can also use this index to change and delete the element.
// We then saw that it is also possible to have arrays containing other arrays;
// these are multidimensional arrays. To access the elements of a
// multidimensional array, you would need to use as many indices as you have
// nested arrays.
// Then, we covered objects and learned that arrays are a special kind of
// object. Objects contain properties and methods. We looked at the properties
// of objects and saw that these properties are given a name and can be
// accessed and modified using this name.
// We ended this module by looking at how arrays can contain objects, and
// how objects can contain arrays and more. This enables us to create complex
// object structures, which will be of great use in designing real-life
// applications.
