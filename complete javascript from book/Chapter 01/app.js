// JavaScript is an amazing multi-functional language that is used a lot for
// web development (among other things). Any interaction that happens on
// web pages is JavaScript in action. In fact, all modern browsers understand
// JavaScript—and soon you will understand it too

// It appears you have decided to start learning JavaScript. Excellent choice!
// JavaScript is a programming language that can be used on both the server
// side and client side of applications. The server side of an application is the
// backend logic that usually runs on computers in data centers and interacts
// with the database, while the client side is what runs on the device of the
// user, often the browser for JavaScript.

// It is not unlikely that you have used functionality written in JavaScript. If
// you have used a web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge,
// then you definitely have. JavaScript is all over the web. If you enter a web
// page and it asks you to accept cookies and you click OK, the popup
// disappears. This is JavaScript in action. And if you want to navigate a
// website and a sub-menu opens up, that means more JavaScript. Often, when
// you filter products in a web shop, this involves JavaScript. And what about
// these chats that start talking to you after you have been on a website for a
// certain number of seconds? Well, you guessed it—JavaScript!
// Pretty much any interaction we have with web pages is because of
// JavaScript; the buttons you are clicking, birthday cards you are creating,
// and calculations you are doing. Anything that requires more than a static
// web page needs JavaScript.
// In this chapter, we will cove

// There are a ton of libraries and frameworks you can use once you get the
// basics of JavaScript down. These libraries and frameworks will really
// enhance your software life and make it a lot easier and possible to get more
// done in less time. Examples of these great libraries and frameworks include
// React, Vue.js, jQuery, Angular, and Node.js. Don't worry about these for
// now; just see them as a bonus for later. We will cover some of them briefly
// at the very end of this book.

// The community of JavaScript is huge. The popular Stack Overflow forum
// contains lots of help for all sorts of coding issues and has an enormous
// section on JavaScript. You'll find yourself running into this web page a lot
// while googling problems and tips and tricks

// How does the browser
// understand JavaScript?

// JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that the computer
// understands it while running it. Some languages get processed before
// running, this is called compiling, but not JavaScript. The computer can just
// interpret JavaScript on the fly. The "engine" that understands JavaScript
// will be called the interpreter here.


// Adding JavaScript to a web
// page

// Directly in HTML 
// Linking an external file to our web page

// Formatting code

// Code needs to be formatted well. If you have a long file with many lines of
// code and you didn't stick to a few basic formatting rules, it is going to be
// hard to understand what you've written. So, what are the basic formatting
// rules? The two most important for now are indentations and semicolons.
// There are also naming conventions, but these will be addressed for every
// topic that is yet to come


// Indentations and whitespace
// Without new lines:
// With new lines but without indentation:
// With new lines and indentation:

// Semicolons;
// After every statement, you should insert a semicolon. 

// Code comments
// 1. You do not want to execute a piece of code while running the script, so
// you comment it out so it gets ignored by the interpreter.
// 2. Metadata. Adding some context to the code, such as the author, and a
/* description of what the file covers.
 3. Adding comments to specific parts of the code to explain what is
 happening or why a certain choice has been made. */

//  Creating an HTML file and a linked
// JavaScript file
// Create an HTML file and create a separate JavaScript file. Then, connect to
// the JavaScript file from the HTML file.
// 1. In the JavaScript file, output your name into the console and add a
// multiple-line comment to your code.
// 2. Try commenting out the console message in your JavaScript file so
// that nothing shows in the console.


// Self-check quiz
// 1. What is the HTML syntax to add an external JavaScript file?
// 2. Can you run JavaScript in a file with a JS extension in your browser?
// 3. How do you write a multiple-line comment in JavaScript?
// 4. What is the best way to remove a line of code from running that you
// might want to keep as you debug?

// Summary;

// Nicely done! You have made a start with JavaScript! In this chapter, we
// have discussed a lot of context, which you will need to know before starting
// to code JavaScript. We saw that we can use JavaScript for many purposes,
// and one of the most popular use cases is the web. Browsers can work with
// JavaScript because they have a special part, called an interpreter, that can
// process JavaScript. We saw that we have multiple options for writing
// JavaScript on our computer. We will need an IDE, a program that we can
// use to write and run our code.
// Adding JavaScript to a web page can be done in several ways. We saw how
// to include it in the script element and how to add a separate JavaScript file
// to a page. We ended this chapter with some important general notes on how
// to write well-structured, readable, and easy-to-maintain code that is well
// documented with comments. We also saw that we can write to the console
// with our console.log() method and ask for user input using prompt() .
// Lastly, we also saw that we can generate random numbers with the
// Math.random() function.
// Next, we'll look at JavaScript's basic data types and the operators that can
// be used to manipulate them!
