<!-- Practice exercise 10.5
Use querySelector() to enable single element selection:
1. Create another simple HTML file.
2. Create four HTML elements adding the same class to each. They can
be different tag names as long as they have the class within the
element attribute.
3. Add some content within each element so you can distinguish between
them.
4. Within a script element, use querySelector() to select the first
occurrence of the elements with that class and store it in a variable. If
there is more than one matching result in querySelector() , it will
return the first one.
5. Output the element into the console. -->
