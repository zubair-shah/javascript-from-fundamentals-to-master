<!-- The Document Object Model
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a lot more exciting than it may
sound at first. In this chapter, we will introduce you to the DOM. This is a
fundamental concept you will need to understand before working with
JavaScript on web pages. It grabs an HTML page and turns it into a logical
tree. If you do not know any HTML, no worries. We start with an HTML
crash course section that you can skip if you are familiar with HTML.
Once we are sure that we are on the same page with HTML knowledge, we
will introduce you to the Browser Object Model (BOM). The BOM holds
all the methods and properties for JavaScript to interact with the browser.
This is information related to previous pages visited, the size of the window
of the browser, and also the DOM.
The DOM contains the HTML elements on the web page. With JavaScript,
we can select and manipulate parts of the DOM. This leads to interactive
web pages instead of static ones. So, long story short, being able to work
with the DOM means you're able to create interactive web pages! -->


<html>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color:pink;">Just an example</h1>
    <div id="one" class="example">Hi!</div>
    <div id="two" class="example">Hi!</div>
    <div id="three" class="something">Hi!</div>
  </body>
  <script>
    console.log(document.getElementById("two"));
  </script>
</html>
