<!-- Accessing elements with a CSS selector
We can also access elements using a CSS selector. We do this with
querySelector() and querySelectorAll() . We then give the CSS selector
as an argument, and this will filter the items in the HTML document and
only return the ones that satisfy the CSS selector.
The CSS selector might look a bit different than you might think at first.
Instead of looking for a certain layout, we use the same syntax as we use
when we want to specify a layout for certain elements. We haven't
discussed this yet, so we will cover it here briefly.
If we state p as a CSS selector, it means all the elements with tag p . This
would look like this:
document.querySelectorAll("p");
If we say p.example , it means all the p tag elements with example as the
class. They can also have other classes; as long as example is in there, it
will match. We can also say #one , which means select all with an ID of
one . -->

        display: none;

      .square {
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
        background-color: yellow;
      }

      .square.blue {
        background-color: blue;
      }
    </style>
    <div id="shape" class="square blue"></div>
    
    <button onclick="disappear()">Disappear!</button>
