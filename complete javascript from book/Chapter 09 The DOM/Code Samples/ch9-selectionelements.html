<!-- Selecting page elements
The document object contains many properties and methods. In order to
work with elements on the page, you'll first have to find them. If you need
to change the value of a certain paragraph, you'll have to grab this
paragraph first. We call this selecting the paragraph. After selecting, we can
start changing it.
To select page elements to use within your JavaScript code and in order to
manipulate elements, you can use either the querySelector() or
querySelectorAll() method. Both of these can be used to select page
elements either by tag name, ID, or class.
The document.querySelector() method will return the first element within
the document that matches the specified selectors. If no matching page
elements are found, the result null is returned. To return multiple
matching elements, you can use the method
document.querySelectorAll() .
The querySelectorAll() method will return a static NodeList , which
represents a list of the document's elements that match the specified group
of selectors. We will demonstrate the usage of both querySelector() and
querySelectorAll() with the following HTML snippet: -->


<!doctype html>
<html>
 <head>
 <title>JS Tester</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1 class="output">Hello World</h1>
 <div class="output">Test</div>
 <script>
//   We are going to select the h1 element with querySelector() . Therefore, if
// there is more than one, it will just grab the first:
  const ele1 = document.querySelector("h1");
console.dir(ele1);
// If you want to select multiple elements, you can use querySelectorAll() .
// This method is going to return all the elements that match the selector in an
// array. In this example, we are going to look for instances of the output
// class, which is done by prepending the class name with a dot.
const eles = document.querySelectorAll(".output");
console.log(eles);

// After selecting, you can start using the dynamic features of the DOM: you
// can manipulate the elements using JavaScript. Content can be changed in
// the same way a variable's contents can be, elements can be removed or
// added, and styles can be adjusted. This can all be done with JavaScript and
// the way the user interacts with the page can affect this. We have seen the
// two most common methods to select in the DOM here, querySelector()
// and querySelectorAll() . You can actually select any element you might
// need with these. There are lots more, which you'll encounter in the next
// chapter, along with many of the ways the DOM can be manipulated.
